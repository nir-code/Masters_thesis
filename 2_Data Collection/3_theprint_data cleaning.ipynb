A Parliament Standing  Committee, comprising MPs of parties that have been vehemently opposing the three new farm laws, has asked for implementation of Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 — one of the three controversial laws — in “letter and spirit”.  The Standing Committee on Food, headed by Trinamool Congress MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay, has members such as Bhagwant Mann from AAP, who had even raised slogans against the laws in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In its report tabled in the Lok Sabha Friday, the panel recommended the government to implement the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.  It said, “There is a need to create an environment based on ease of doing business and for removing  the fear of frequent statutory controls under the Essential Commodities Act in order to boost immediate investment in the agriculture sector, increase competition and enhance farmers’ income”. Both TMC and AAP, along with other parties such as Congress, Shiv Sena, have been demanding a repeal of all the three farm laws brought by the Centre last year.  However, soon after the report was made public Saturday, Congress MP Saptagiri Sankar Ulaka, from Koraput in Odisha, wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and said he didn’t want to be associated with the committee’s latest recommendation. Written to Hon'ble @loksabhaspeaker to dissociate myself from the Eleventh Report of the Standing Committee on Food, Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution on the subject matter – 'Price Rise of Essential Commodities – Causes and Effects' tabled in Parliament on 19.03.2021. pic.twitter.com/qsuh5KC8tt — Saptagiri Ulaka (@saptagiriulaka) March 20, 2021 In his letter, Ulaka argued that “the subject of essential commodities-causes and effects was taken up by the committee much before the three farm ordinances and the related farm laws were passed”. He said the matter was discussed by the committee over three days, on 5 and 19 January in 2019 and again on 16 January 2020. The MP alleged that the draft report on the subject was “circulated only via email to the Related Section of the committee” at 7 pm on 17 March and adopted the next day under acting chairperson Ajay Mishra Teni. Ulaka said he was absent when the report was adopted as the meeting took place in a short span of 15 hours. He urged the lok sabha speaker that he be dissociated from a line in page 62 of the report where the committee has recommended implementing the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 in “letter and spirit”. The parliamentarian also noted that the essential commodity act infringes on federalism, and encourages hoarding and black marketing. Ulaka further pointed out that the committee did not seek oral evidence from any farmer group or independent expert before finalising the report. “It is not only misleading to the nation but also against the norms and convention of the functioning and the democratic spirit of the parliamentary standing committee,” his letter stated. Thousands of farmers primarily from Punjab and Haryana have been camping at the Delhi borders for months now, demanding a complete repeal of the laws. In the report, the committee cited recommendations from chief ministers of various states like Punjab, Maharashtra, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Arunachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh to call for an effective implementation of the farm law. It also cited suggestions from a High-Powered Committee for Transformation of Indian Agriculture, comprising officials of the Department of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare and NITI Aayog. The panel said, “Farmers have been unable to get better prices of their produce due to lack of investment in cold storage, warehouses, processing and export as entrepreneurs were discouraged by the regulatory mechanisms in the older Essential Commodities Act, 1955”. In the report, the committee also said infrastructure building was discouraged by the previous Essential Commodity Act, which resulted in farmers suffering huge losses when there were bumper harvests, especially of perishable commodities, much of which could have been reduced with adequate processing facilities. ThePrint reached both Bandyopadhyay and Mann through text messages and calls for a comment, but there was no response till the time of publishing this report. Mann raised slogans in PM’s presence Mann, addressing a press conference in December 2020, said he raised slogans in front of PM Modi, demanding an immediate rollback of the laws. “We wanted to reach out to the prime minister and tell him about the demands of farmers. AAP MP Shri Sanjay Singh and I raised slogans, demanding MSP law, the rollback of these black laws and others. We were also carrying posters on these demands made by farmers,” Mann had said. He further claimed there is a nexus between the Congress and the BJP as the opposition party is protesting only to show off. That’s why Congress leaders present in the Central Hall did not raise their issues, he had claimed. Committee’s suggestions In the report, the committee expects that the recently enacted ‘The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020’ “will become a catalyst for unlocking vast untapped resources in the agriculture sector by creating an environment for enhanced investments in agriculture sector, fair and productive competition in agricultural marketing and increase farmers’ income”. However, the committee noted that food items  such as potato, onions and pulses are part of a common man’s daily diet and that lakhs of people who do not get the benefits of Public Distribution System (PDS) may suffer adversely in the aftermath of the implementation of the new Act. The committee wanted the government to continue to keep a constant watchful eye on the prices of all essential commodities and to resort to the remedial provisions provided in the Act when called for. It further asked the government to take all necessary steps to streamline the free movement of essential commodities to ensure affordable prices of such items for all citizens.

President’s office still relevant, especially in case of constitutional crisis. CAA is by no means such a crisis Makarand R. Paranjape   \n"," Director, Indian Institute of Advanced Study \n"," The President’s office is still relevant, especially in the case of a constitutional crisis. The brouhaha over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is by no means such a crisis. The bill was passed fair and square after a debate in both houses of Parliament. Those who argue that the CAA is unjust and was passed only because of a brute majority are mistaken. It is majorities, brute or otherwise, who pass bills, enact legislation, and run democracies. Calling them names when we disagree with them betrays a lack of understanding of, if not disrespect for, democratic institutions. Why don’t the disgruntled move an amendment to include Muslims facing religious persecution in the CAA? If such an amendment passes, even those who are happy with the Act as it stands right now will have to accept it. That is how democracies function. But to argue that the President should rescind a law just because members of the opposition find it unpalatable or politically inexpedient goes against the letter and spirit of the Constitution. It is not a question of whether the office of the President is still relevant. The real question is – why the opposition made up of a bunch of naysayers and bad losers. Views are personal. Opposition approaching President after his assent to CAA is an act of political posturing Subhash Kashyap \n"," Former secretary-general, Lok Sabha and author The President of India has ceased to have a role anymore. President Kovind has already given his assent to the Citizenship Amendment Act. Both houses of Parliament have also passed it. It has now become a law. The President’s relevance was lost right after he gave his assent. The opposition parties now have the option of moving the Supreme Court. The President is also a constituent part of Parliament. The President’s assent becomes an essential part of the legislative process. The act of approaching the President after his assent is merely political posturing. Constitutionally speaking, an Indian President doesn’t have a political role. Additionally, it is not like the President’s office is the Supreme Court wherein you have the option of filing mercy petitions. There have been cases in the past where a bill has been passed in Parliament but the President chose not to give his assent. President Kovind had the chance but he chose otherwise in the case of CAA. It would have been more beneficial for the opposition parties to approach him before he gave his assent. Opposition’s appeal to President Kovind won’t get CAA withdrawn, but it signals how important the issue is  Shivam Vij \n"," Contributing editor, ThePrint \n"," The most egregious abdication of responsibility by President Ram Nath Kovind so far has been the overnight lifting of the President’s Rule in Maharashtra, to facilitate the secretive swearing-in of Devendra Fadnavis. The President of India is meant to be a rubber stamp on most days, and the current President is from the ruling party. Indians have seen worse Presidents, especially Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed who signed the Emergency declaration. And yet the office of the President is bigger than the person who occupies the post. The office should not be judged by who occupies it because that can change. The office of the President of India has a symbolic value. It stands for the Republic, and for the Constitution in a symbolic way that cannot be repudiated either by daily politics or by the incumbent President’s political pressures. This is an office that must be appealed to by the opposition, and by every citizen of India who feels the government of the day is not doing justice to him or her. It is easy to be cynical about the value of the President’s office at a time when the Narendra Modi government has absolute power and is unstoppable in asserting its brute majority against constitutional morality. It is, therefore, important to invoke constitutional morality by appealing to the office of the President of India, and the conscience of the incumbent at Rashtrapati Bhavan. The opposition’s appeal to President Kovind is not going to get the Citizenship (Amendment) Act withdrawn, but it is an important way of signalling to the public how important the issue is. Nothing wrong in opposition meeting President Kovind. His office can’t change govt’s mind anyway  Alok Prasanna Kumar \n"," Senior Resident Fellow, Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy I think the office of the President gains relevance in the absence of real powers. The President of India is supposed to be like the Queen of England who doesn’t have any political power. It is not like the opposition parties are appealing to a court or an executive authority. They are appealing to President Ram Nath Kovind simply because there is a provision to do so. I don’t think there is anything fundamentally wrong with that. The President is supposed to listen and speak to everyone but can’t make the government do things or change its mind. In fact, the President acts on the central government’s advice. The President’s office is relevant in India’s parliamentary democracy. There may be good or bad Presidents or those who agree or disagree with the ruling parties. But as long as they know their limits, the office remains relevant. In the past, Indian Presidents have taken a stand. They have threatened to exercise a pocket veto. Former President Pratibha Patil commuting death sentences of 35 convicts to life imprisonment could also be seen as taking a stand. An assertive President doesn’t mean s/he picks a public fight. It won’t bode well for the central government or the President. Nobody expects the President to use independent discretion. India’s first President Rajendra Prasad tried to do that and that resulted in Jawaharlal Nehru being in a constant conflict with him. Former Presidents like Giani Zail Singh, Abdul Kalam, and Pranab Mukherjee proved to be assertive in different ways. Meek and weak political appointees to Rashtrapati Bhavan, including President Kovind, only follow their party’s agenda  Maneesh Chhibber  \n"," Columnist After every contentious law is passed or the central government does something seemingly unconstitutional, the opposition — irrespective of which party or combination of parties — approaches the President to seek their intervention. But, little, if anything, ever happens. Now that the Congress, DMK, TMC, CPI and BSP have approached President Kovind on the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act, it will be interesting to see whether he proves to be better than most of his predecessors. But, having seen President Kovind’s performance since his election in 2017, one has little hope. After all, he did quietly play along, even signing on the dotted lines at 5.47 am when the Narendra Modi cabinet revoked President’s Rule last month to facilitate the swearing-in of BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis as Maharashtra’s chief minister. Meek and weak political appointees elected and sent to Rashtrapati Bhavan in recent years have always implemented the agenda of the party that nominated him or her. President Kovind will prove to be no different.

best of the day’s opinion, chosen and curated by ThePrint’s top editors.Faizan Mustafa | Vice chancellor, NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad \n"," The Hindu Mustafa writes that all the petitions on Article 370, that are being referred to a Constitution Bench by the Supreme Court, call for deep scrutiny. Firstly, the Centre’s move to amend Article 370 could be struck down by the apex court as ‘unconstitutional’ using the very same article. Article 370 “has not been abrogated”, he says. Instead, the government has invoked the article to amend Article 367. J&amp;K was already under President’s Rule, but the Parliament – by exercising ‘powers’ of the Legislative Assembly – gave its license to intervene in Article 370. However, Mustafa says that this may not be upheld by legal scrutiny–“what you cannot do directly, you cannot even do indirectly,’’ he writes. Secondly, breaking up of J&amp;K into two Union territories is a blow to federalism and may not be constitutionally valid. The state was under President’s Rule and the Parliament is technically just a “night watchman” that cannot pass resolutions to bifurcate the state. Thirdly, most of the Constitution was already applicable to J&amp;K. In reality, “the ‘special status’ Article 370 conferred was not to J&amp;K but to the Central government”. PK Mishra | The writer is additional principal secretary to the prime minister \n"," The Times of India Mishra writes that in today’s “interconnected world” there is a pressing need to use technology and science to understand the risks of disaster. The National Disaster Management Authority is working with the scientific community to create a futuristic agenda for this. Huge improvements have been made in forecasting and understanding incidents of extreme climate, weather and natural disaster. But two challenges still persist. First, the time lag between scientific and technology being available and its actual application. Second, ensuring that scientific research leads to development of tools and methods that shift the focus from disaster to risk management, while still fostering innovation. Three principles should be followed in the future, the author says. First, a clearer definition of “disaster risk management problems” should lead progressive scientific outcomes. Second, disaster risk management science should be applied at the local level, while also searching for scalable solutions. Third, a multi-disciplinary approach needs to look at the interaction between hazards and its risks. A “responsive government and a risk-aware community” is also key. The upcoming “Global Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure” will be an important platform to develop this agenda. Sanjib Baruah | The writer is professor of political studies, Bard College, New York \n"," The Indian Express Baruah writes that the phrase “India’s internal matter” has become commonly used by the country’s diplomacy to ward off criticism over the abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir. But the phrase was also used by External Affairs minister S Jaishankar in regards to Assam’s NRC issue, during a visit to Bangladesh last week. He assured Bangladesh’s foreign minister, who was worried about consequences of potential deportation to the neighbouring country, that he need not worry. The 2014 Supreme Court ruling regarding NRC stated that mechanisms would be put in place to deport illegal immigrants. But Jaishankar clearly declared to Dhaka that there would be no deportation, and it is too risky to alienate Bangladesh in terms of foreign policy right now. Legal and regularisation measures would be India’s next option. But defining lakhs of people in the country as non-citizens is a new form of “precarious citizenship” that is dangerous for our democracy. It is likely that the Citizenship Amendment Bill will be brought back to the Parliament and successfully passed. Those once party to the “Assam movement” might rejoice but the future of Assam will be very different” from what they had imagined. Kaushik Basu | Professor of economics at Cornell University and nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution \n"," Mint Basu writes that the Amazon crisis is an example of the damage which takes place when governments bow to business interests. He also argues that the crisis “highlights an increasingly common phenomenon: the cynical manipulation of anti-corruption efforts to undermine democracy and advance an authoritarian political agenda”. He cites the latest Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) released by Transparency International to argue that “there is a strong inverse correlation between development and corruption”. He also argues that corruption levels change in societies and gives examples of countries like Singapore and Japan which have become some of the least corrupt nations globally. He writes that addressing corruption is not a straightforward process and many leaders with a genuine interest in controlling it often end up promoting cronyism and damaging democracy. He adds that many motivated “anti-corruption” campaigns entrench existing power imbalances and help undemocratic regimes to rise.

They mention that the government has “relaxed the limits on investment in the entities engaged in the business of coal mining, and contract manufacturing, while relaxing the local sourcing requirements for single brand retail trading (SBRT)”. They mention that the changes “open up the coal mining sector to foreign investment beyond just captive use”. They also write that while “100 per cent FDI is allowed under the automatic route for the manufacturing sector” there wasn’t enough clarity on outsourcing of manufacturing activities – “that is, contract manufacturing”. They mention that now “a provision for contract manufacturing has been introduced”.

Neelkanth Mishra | Co-head of Asia Pacific Strategy and India Strategist for Credit Suisse \n"," The Indian Express Neelkanth Mishra writes that India is going through a slowdown and the trend gets amplified on several fronts. He writes that the tightening of the financial conditions after a large financial firm defaulted a year back pushed more companies into default. He also mentions that “relatively small fluctuations in end demand can get amplified further up in the supply chain”. Also, any slowdown in economic activity affects government’s revenues. To overcome economic slowdown, he recommends that the government “needs to take an axe to the system, as a scalpel will no longer suffice”. He suggests large scale disinvestments to address the fiscal shortfall and maintaining government spending growth, particularly on infrastructure.

Both surveys show a despondent sentiment. She writes that the July budget further dented the sentiment when the government announced unanticipated tax surcharges. She writes that the post-budget downturn in sentiment led to a government response and it rolled back some of the measures which were creating fears of tax terrorism.

S ince the Supreme Court’s judgment on  28 September, 2018  overturning the bar on the entry of women aged 10-50 years into the 800-year old Sabarimala temple in Kerala, there has been a spirited debate on the issue of government interference in religious affairs, with passionately argued views and counter views offered on the merits and demerits of the court’s judgment. Interestingly, those projecting the Sabarimala issue as one of gender justice and women’s equality are quick to draw comparisons with the Modi government’s effort to end the practice of triple talaq. There is an argument that permitting the entry of women into Sabarimala is not only about ensuring women’s rights, but also to be seen in the context of the so-called innately discriminatory attributes within Hinduism—if the entry of women is to be barred, will banning individuals from lower caste groups from worshipping at Hindu temples also be accepted? We find both these arguments to be specious. The Sabarimala issue is not about caste or gender justice. The Sabarimala temple has a well-defined raison d’être—the Ayyappa deity here is worshipped as one who has renounced the world and is celibate. The richness of the Hindu tradition is that there are other Ayyappa temples across southern India where the deity is worshipped in different forms and through varying methods. At the Kulathupuzha temple, Ayyappa appears as a child. At the Achankovil temple, Ayyappa is worshipped as one who participates in family life. This is not different from how  Ravana is worshipped  in some parts of India, even as his likeness is set on fire on Vijayadashmi all across the country. The key fact is that no centralised, institutional gender or caste discrimination is being corrected by the court’s diktat on allowing a certain age group of women to pray at the temple. Just as Sabarimala temple bans the entry of women of a certain age group, the Kamrup  Kamakhya temple  in Assam allows only menstruating women to worship. Moreover, there are prominent Hindu temples that do not permit the entry of men. The 600-year-old Brahma temple in Pushkar, Rajasthan does not permit married men to worship the deity, for example. Hinduism weaves a rich tapestry of multitudinous deities, gods and goddesses that are worshipped in myriad ways. There is no one book to follow—and no central authority that dictates terms. The Supreme Court, in its wisdom, overturned the 1991 judgment of the Kerala High Court that upheld the customs of the Sabarimala temple. The judgment itself is discriminatory in that it does not seek to provide equality to all women irrespective of religion: non-Hindu women can still be barred from entering their places of worship and indeed Hindu women who may be barred from entering other Hindu temples are also not affected by the apex court’s judgment. When three women tried to enter a mosque in Kerala, they were promptly  arrested  by the police. The court has picked on a particular temple and provided for a specific judgment that only applies to that temple, rather than pronounce that equality in worship applies to all religions and regions, and that no women can be discriminated against by anybody in the matter of access to a place of worship. Is it justice to say, let another PIL be filed and only then the honourable court would decide on that issue after a few more decades have passed? The second, and even more problematic, issue is with India’s judges anointing onto themselves spiritual-theological exegesis in their drive to determine what is ‘essential religious practice’. Justice Indu Malhotra, in her  dissenting opinion  in the Sabarimala case, said as much. She noted ‘what constitutes an essential religious practice is for the religious community to decide’. The genesis of this unfortunate situation emerges from shying away from stating that there is, indeed, a basic minimum standard of human rights and constitutional guarantees available to each and every Indian, without regard to their  ascriptive  identity. Unable to raise itself to the level where it can proclaim that a given set of freedoms and liberties is inviolable, no matter what any religion or group asserts, Indian jurisprudence has taken refuge in selectively picking on the Hindu faith under the Nehruvian rubric of ‘protection’ to minorities. This has usually been to the advantage of Hindus, where state power has pushed Hindus towards more social liberalism. The confusion and absurdities created by this mindset can manifest in ugly, unexpected ways – when the Lok Sabha moved a bill removing  leprosy  as a ground for divorce earlier this week, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen MP Asaduddin Owaisi  opposed it,  saying “don’t interfere in Muslim personal law”, holding up the example of Pakistan and Bangladesh, which still allow divorce on this discriminatory ground. Owaisi echoed Jawaharlal Nehru, who also wanted to “protect” Muslims and declined to reform Muslim personal laws in 1955 when Hindu laws were reformed. But leaving minorities out in the cold in the name of ‘protecting’ them is only widening the fissures in Indian society, where one section of the population experiences liberal state policy—such as freedom to divorce only with mutual consent and freedom to adopt children—but a large minority is subjected to ultra-conservative religious law that is provided state backing in the name of ‘protection’. Given both the executive and the judiciary’s hesitation in pushing for equal laws, a uniform civil code and equal treatment of all religions, the incumbent legal regime and juridical practice have ended up splintering Hindus. Politically, of course, a fissiparous Hindu society works to the great advantage of those who are allied with conservative Islamists. There is a fundamental difference between monotheistic, centralised Abrahamic faiths and the polytheistic, pantheistic, ‘pagan’ Hinduism. When individuals decided to build temples for living figures such as Amitabh Bachchan, Rajinikanth and Sachin Tendulkar, nobody could stop them. Hinduism has no barriers to entry, unlike the Abrahamic faith that are controlled by a centralised clergy or theology. There is no one Vatican or one Mecca for the Hindu—there is no codified directive to the Hindu on how to worship, where to worship, when to worship or even whether to worship, and Hinduism should be recognised for its uniqueness. An attempt to homogenise Hindus using state power erodes the diversity of Hinduism and only semitises it.
