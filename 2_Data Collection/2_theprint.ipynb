Opposition can learn from anti-CAA protests ahead of Bihar and West Bengal assembly elections.E ighteen opposition parties and 31 farmer organisations have come together to oppose Narendra Modi government’s apparently ill-thought out farm laws, which they wanted a select committee to review before passing in the Rajya Sabha due to the evident lacunae in them. But the opposition was bulldozed. Some experts claim that these legislation can eventually lead to formations of monopolies, oligopolies and cartels. But how will the Opposition convince the Indian public about the ill-effects of these farm sector reforms? The opposition parties may have come together – a rare occurrence nowadays – but can they sustain, be effective and mobilise mass uprising? Speaking boldly on Twitter, broadcasting self-recorded videos from central hall and giving TV bytes aren’t going to be enough, not with the upcoming Bihar and West Bengal elections at stake.   Modi and his politics have set new paradigms and opposing them will also require political innovation on part of the Opposition. Sloganeering and throwing papers in the House in hope that a live telecast will make them look like heroes — who stood for a cause — back in their respective constituencies is so last decade. If anything, this is what Modi and his politics feeds on — ‘look at them, they didn’t do much when they were in power, they don’t want me to do it for you now’. Opposition trying to consolidate The Opposition has decided to rake up these issues jointly. Congress has already launched its nation-wide protest while Shiromani Akali Dal’s lone minister in Modi government, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, walked out of the government to express her displeasure with these laws. Left, NCP, DMK, Samajwadi Party, Trinamool Congress and the RJD — the usual suspects — have also joined in. But how effective will this bunch be? Before the 2019 Lok Sabha election, these parties had come together as a joint front to decimate the Modi-Amit Shah juggernaut. But the election result revealed that the attempt was a damp squib. The fact that the Congress continually wanted to ascertain itself as the leading national opposition party, which it was, made it take decisions that were not favourable to the joint opposition. Regional leaders like Chandrababu Naidu and Arvind Kejriwal who nurtured aspirations to establish themselves at the centre kept looking for PR opportunities to make them appear at par with Modi. This turned the joint opposition into a Frankenstein that may have looked like a giant but didn’t have a functioning mind. The same will eventually happen with these farmer protests. Congress is already leading its own nationwide protest while regional leaders, besides the Chautalas and Badals, don’t really care all that much. Their participation in the agitation against the legislation is only to embarrass the government for the way it has stripped Parliamentary rules and decorum. In fact, much has been spoken previously, too, on MSP and how the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has utterly failed in the farming sector with rising farmer suicides. …but it has a poor strike rate The 2018 farmer protests that saw farmers from Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh  marching on foot all the way to Delhi to ask for debt relief and better MSP on crops was seen as the Modi government’s biggest threat. But all that came crashing down on 23 May when the BJP alone won 303 seats. The joint opposition raking up the Rafael deal and following it up with the ‘Chowkidar chor Hai’ campaign also led to a disgraceful dead end for the Opposition. The Opposition is using tried and tested failed methods to showcase the policy failures of the Modi government. A citizens’-led movement opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) had much more fervour than any of the joint Opposition protests. This was because it was a ground-up movement, not coming down from the ‘high command’ of any opposition party. The Opposition needs to focus on disseminating the failures of this government on ground, and go door-to-door, through their karyakartas because, by now, it has become clear that their big camera-oriented protests are fizzling out eventually. To understand why this is important, just see what Modi did — at the first sign of the protests gathering momentum, he announced an increase in MSP for six rabi crops and followed it up by asking the BJP workers to spread awareness on the legislation. The Opposition needs to realise that much of its agitation in the past have failed to showcase the glaring failures of the Modi government, including major policy failures such as demonetisation, faulty Goods and Services Tax (GST) implementation, Kashmir, China and now the agri ‘reforms’  because none of the voters are convinced about how bad the Modi government’s policies actually are. And that is because the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and BJP’s propaganda machinery along with their foot soldiers are much more effective in canvassing Modi and his policies. The Opposition usually gets irked for being questioned on their failed attempts to showcase the government’s failures. It questions those who seek answers from them and demands that only the government be held responsible. Yes, the government is accountable, but what if those responsible for keeping it on toes are themselves going off balance — issue after issue. Their failure means the government will continue to frame policies that hurt India’s interest. Questioning the government today, even in the well of the upper House, like \n","Derek O’Brien did, is not leading to any answers from the Centre. Only voters have the power to tell Modi and Co — ‘no, you are doing it all wrong’. But that will only happen if the Opposition learns how to reach out to people and explain to them everything that this government is hurting since 2014 — from economy to jobs to farmers.

But Sunil Jakhar says Centre’s intentions are suspect. Protesting farmers are playing into the hands of the Narendra Modi government by not allowing the passage of passenger trains into the state, Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee President Sunil Jakhar told ThePrint Tuesday.   “While Centre may have invited farmers for talks, the farmers are playing into the hands of the Centre by not allowing passage of passenger trains. Because the Centre is not affected by stoppage of trains in any way and neither do they care about Punjab or its farmers,” said the former Gurdaspur MP. His comments come amid the continued suspension of trains to Punjab by the central government and the ongoing protest by the state’s farmers against the  three contentious farm legislations passed by the Centre in September. Since 1 October, farmers protesting against the farm laws launched an indefinite ‘rail roko’ agitation. While most of the farmer bodies called off their agitation on 23 October and decided to allow goods trains to pass in view of the acute shortage of coal and fertiliser supply, they decided not to allow any passenger trains to pass through. But the Railways has refused to restore goods train services as well over issues of security. Now, the Modi government has  invited the farmers for talks to the national capital on 13 November in a bid to end the impasse.  In a telephonic interview, the state chief of the ruling Congress labeled the Centre’s intentions as suspect, saying that it is playing a dangerous blinking game with the farmers. He also called the protests valid, adding that the Centre’s minimum support price (MSP) assurance is a “misnomer”. ‘Centre’s intentions suspect’ Sunil Jakhar said that while the Centre has now called the farmers for talks, their intentions are “suspect”. “Captain Amarinder Singh himself has approached the Centre earlier to listen to the farmers but the response has not been encouraging,” he said. On Monday, ThePrint  reported that while a meeting has been proposed by the BJP’s Harjeet Singh Grewal between a delegation of the protesting farmers and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Railways Minister Piyush Goyal — farmer unions have said that they have only been sent feelers for the meeting. “If you see what the farmer unions are saying, it appears that the Centre’s overtures for a meeting is a mere eyewash,” Jakhar said. He added that the Modi government does not care about the farmers and their protest does not affect the Centre in any way. “The BJP is playing a very dangerous blinking game with the farmers to see who will blink first. But the farmers should realise that this will be a long drawn struggle. To the BJP, Punjab and its farmers don’t matter. For them it’s only 13 seats in the Lok Sabha, of which they win only two anyway. So they don’t care about Punjab,” he said. ‘Farmers protest valid’ The farmers’ opposition is to the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, which allows farmers to sell their produce outside Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMC); the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, which allows contract farming; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020, which deregulates the production, supply, distribution of certain food items. According to Jakhar, farmers’ reservations to these bills are “valid” and the BJP-led central government is trying to abolish the prevalent agricultural system in Punjab. “Land is much more fertile in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. But then why do their farmers come here to sell their produce? It’s because they don’t have the mandi system and infrastructure that we have established across the state which allows our farmers to get fair prices for their produce at MSP,” he said. Jakhar decried the Centre’s assurance that the MSP system will  continue . “Centre’s assurance that the MSP will continue is just a misnomer. They actually want to reduce and cap MSP and eventually do away with it. In a sense they want to pull the carpet from under the farmers’ feet,” he said. “The BJP’s claims that contract farming will not affect farmers is also wrong, because it is just another way of taking away farmers’ land and giving it to corporates.” ‘Power shortage due to coal shortage’ ThePrint had  reported that with the continued  suspension of freight trains to Punjab, the  electricity-surplus state has been left grappling with a power crisis.   Sunil Jakhar pinned the blame for this on the BJP and the previous Shiromani Akali Dal government for privatisation of power plants — another key protest site for the agitating farmers. “There’s monumental corruption in the three private power plants, which were brought in by the Badals who were hand in glove with the corporates. The farmers may want the government plants to run and that is why they are protesting at the private plants but even for the government plants to run we need coal,” he said.  That’s why, Jakhar said, farmers’ move of stopping trains is not prudent. “Blocking trains in Punjab doesn’t make sense. Farmers should realise that they are cutting their own roots. We need coal to run the government plants,” he said. “Otherwise to run the government plants we will need to buy from the central grid. But where’s the money to do that? We already have dues worth Rs 25,000 crore to the central grid,” he added. ‘Stubble burning resolution boils down to finances’ Not just power shortage, Jakhar said the resolution of Punjab’s stubble burning issue, which contributes massively to the air pollution in north India, also boils down to finances.   “It all boils down to the economy. Any single day delay in sowing of paddy impacts the cultivation. Farmers need machines that can sow these crops fast. But these machines are expensive. Biomass machines are not cheap. Centre should give financial assistance to Punjab to get these machines. Farmers also need big tractors to pull these machines which are expensive. Where is the money for all this?” he asked.

He was the foreign minister  during  the Mumbai 26/11 terror attacks in 2008. His second stint, this time in the Imran Khan government, has been rocked by the Pulwama attack, the Balakot airstrikes and now the Modi government’s decision to abrogate Article 370 for Jammu and Kashmir. But these moments of tensions appear to have done nothing to sharpen his diplomacy in the times of crisis. Shah Mahmood Qureshi seems to have no concrete policy to deal with the situation arising out of revocation of Article 370. He appears to be more preoccupied with bombastic and  vituperative tweets  and press conference limelight. His Kashmir statements are in contrast to those of seasoned Indian diplomats, such as S. Jaishankar, Vijay Gokhale and  Syed Akbaruddin , who have managed the Kashmir fallout internationally with backroom finesse and deft. No longer on the back foot Qureshi has, in recent months, followed Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan’s doctrine of throwing loud tantrums to draw attention. This includes exaggerated claims of  genocide  in Kashmir, painting a Palestine-like scenario, and even playing the victim card  alleging impending Indian aggression. His incendiary rage in the last few weeks is in sharp contrast to the mild demeanour he displayed in the aftermath of the  26/11 attacks . What has not changed in all these years is his ability to peddle half-truths in impeccable anglicised English. Except Qureshi is no longer on the back foot this time as the crisis around Article 370  shows. Qureshi has even acknowledged that the world isn’t paying attention to Kashmir like it used to. He  lamented that despite repeatedly mentioning Kashmir to the global community and the publicity stunts (such as getting Pakistani citizens to stand and observe Kashmir Hour) to rake up the Kashmir cause, Islamabad hasn’t been able to move the needle. The global community hasn’t really bought Islamabad’s championing of the human rights cause in its geopolitical quest for Kashmir. Qureshi  said  that Pakistan pledges to “guarantee the rights” of minorities and protect  temples , churches and gurdwaras. Given that Islamabad has long abdicated the same rights for its minorities – Balochis, Pakthuns, Shias, Ahmadis, Parsis, Christians, Hindus and Sikhs – there are no takers for his pitch. The 2008 crisis Many in India remember Qureshi from another point of crisis – the Mumbai terror attacks. Back in November 2008, then foreign minister Qureshi was getting ready to address a press conference in India even as the security forces were fighting the terrorists in Mumbai. Before Qureshi’s presser could start, he received a phone call from his Indian counterpart at that time – Pranab Mukherjee – who insisted that he must leave the country. Qureshi reportedly insisted that he could continue, but Mukherjee was firm. Over the next few weeks, Qureshi went on the  defensive , battling India’s dossier-for-dossier avalanche with the usual clichéd Rawalpindi/Islamabad ripostes along the lines of  ‘India hasn’t given us enough proof ’ or ‘ it takes time to process the evidence in a legal setting such as this’. Qureshi has long been dubbed as a prime minister-in-waiting. He was overlooked for the coveted post when his former party, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), won the elections of 2008. But then the 26/11 attacks happened. And in the aftermath of the  Raymond Davis incident, Qureshi was  sacked . ‘A parody of diplomacy’ A recent Op-ed in the Pakistani daily  Dawn excoriated Imran Khan and Qureshi by saying that “ the latest crisis has badly exposed the amateurishness of our leadership in dealing with critical issues”.  The article rebuked Qureshi’s penchant for soundbites and said he had “ made a parody of diplomacy”.  His need to say something on everything at every moment through every medium he can find has turned “ serious matters into political gimmickry”. Qureshi’s bombastic  announcement in the National Assembly that Islamabad would suspend bilateral ties with New Delhi accentuates his ‘style over substance’ approach. This, given that trade between the two countries is negligible and Pakistan has  never given  India an MFN status, despite the latter having previously done so. The same speech saw him asking his fellow Assembly members to cheer ‘Kashmir Banega Pakistan’ , after parroting lines on Kashmir’s right to self-determination. He recently  attended  the wedding of controversial filmmaker/newscaster Hamza Ali Abbasi, a known India-baiter who has  interviewed and praised Hafiz Saeed.  It’s no wonder that one foreign policy commentator remarked  that “ Pakistan army wishes it had picked someone smarter”. Shortly after the Balakot airstrike, Qureshi committed a faux pas in an interview by saying  that his government was in touch with Jaish-e-Mohammed, the UN-proscribed terror group. His incessant habit of making  truculent remarks was on display even when the Indian team wore military caps in honour of the security personnel killed in Pulwama. Had this been against Pakistan, on Pakistani soil, perhaps, there could have been a case. However, this was at a home game in Ranchi against Australia, but Pakistan and Qureshi’s churlishness were there for all to see. Achilles’ heel exposed But it is not just Qureshi. Even Pakistan finds itself in a bind today, with none of its Gulf and Islamic allies regurgitating the old lines on Kashmir. First, the United Arab Emirates stated that the abrogation of Article 370 was India’s internal matter. Adding more salt to Islamabad’s inflamed Kashmir wound, Abu Dhabi’s crown prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan honoured Prime Minister Modi with the UAE’s highest civilian award . All this as Khan and the entire establishment continues its Twitter backlash. Pakistan’s flawed policy of homogenising Islamic nations to kowtow to Islamabad’s position has exposed its Achilles’ heel, a position that Qureshi conceded  to. Qureshi isn’t like his predecessors. He doesn’t exhibit statesman-like qualities the way Khurshid Kasuri or Sartaz Aziz did. Neither does he seem as amiable as Hina Rabbani Khar, who succeeded him as the foreign minister in 2011. In fact, he has long been seen as a Kashmir hawk. But the latest crisis has exposed his inadequacies only too well. Since Modi and Amit Shah’s 5 August decision, his talons have been out; will his wings be clipped too like last time?

The company informed the government that it will be launching voice over WiFi services very soon, thus enabling calls in areas with poor mobile signals,  reports   The Economic Times . Remember the fanfare with which Tata Nano was launched in 2008? India’s ‘magic vehicle’ is nearing its end with just one unit produced last month,  reports   The Economic Times . The entry-level car sold just three units in June in the domestic market. Point of View The Supreme Court Wednesday restored the authority of the elected government in Delhi in administrative matters. The Indian Express, in its  editorial,  writes, “SC upholds a basic democratic principle: Elected governments have the upper hand.” The Hindu added in its editorial, “The SC clarifies an elected government cannot be undermined by an unelected administrator (read L-G).” Union minister Arun Jaitley has described the Prevention of Corruption Act as a “charter for bringing government to a standstill”. The Times Of India  writes in its  editorial , “This legislation is not only badly drafted but is clearly at odds with policies governments have pursued since 1991. It certainly deserves to be amended.” The latest RBI financial stability report ‘tries to sound optimistic’ . It says credit picked up in 2017-18 despite a poor deposit rate, but sees banks’ gross non-performing advances (GNPA) ratio worsening between 2018 and 2019. Journalist Chaitanya Kalbag, in his  column  in The Economic Times , writes about the problem of rising non-performing assets (NPAs) and how it poses a threat to the banking system in India. The Haryana government’s notification asking sportspersons  employed by the government to deposit “one-third of the income earned” from professional engagements with the state created a storm. Ashok Khemka, Haryana sports secretary, in his  column  in The Indian Express, writes, “It is not a draconian provision of a state mafia, rather it is an enabling provision that works both to the benefit of the sportsperson and society.” (With inputs from Prateek

The defeat in the 1962 war with China and the victory in the 1971 war happened immediately after elections earlier in the year and can’t be used as gauges. However, the Sri Lanka fiasco and Bofors took a heavy toll on Rajiv Gandhi,  wiping out  his government in the 1989 Lok Sabha elections. The victory in the Kargil War propelled Atal Bihari Vajpayee to a  victory  in 1999. The 26/11 Mumbai attacks were undeniably a massive intelligence and security failure, and yet  in state elections  a few days later, the Congress trounced the BJP. Confused? So am I. While overarching trends are difficult to make out, there are some allegories that bear repeating. Subramanian Swamy, for example, recalls how when he met Deng Xiaoping, and the latter confided to him words to the effect of “we expected India to break up when we defeated you in 1962, yet all it did was wipe out calls for separatism from Tamil Nadu and bound you together stronger”. If memory serves me right, Rajiv Gandhi said at a Congress Parliamentary Party meet in 1989 that “India is strong in victory, but it is even stronger in defeat.” For the reader’s ease, I shall refer to this phenomenon as the Deng-Rajiv principle. It’s a pity, then, that this great leader’s son, Rahul Gandhi preferred internalising superficially applied European social democrat paradigms and ignored his own father’s wisdom. What was his cardinal sin? India, like any pre-industrial state was, is, and possibly till a post-industrial phase, will be, a fiercely nationalistic country. This is not to say Indians don’t accept that their leaders make huge security goof ups, or their leaders shouldn’t be criticised for it, but rather that they believe there is a time and place for such criticism and wartime is not it. This is where Pulwama and Balakot effectively turned out to be Rahul Gandhi’s proverbial Waterloo. Assume for a minute that everything the detractors of the Balakot strikes and the air battle that followed said were true, that India missed its targets, and the Air Force did not perform well on that day or the next. The Deng-Rajiv principle dictated, that Rahul Gandhi stay quiet or express some form of support. Instead, he and his press minions went on a rampage calling everyone from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to the Air Force ‘liars’. A programme on the Congress politician-supported channel Tiranga TV went as far as to verbatim copy a  Pakistan military -linked video regurgitating charges against an Italian journalist (who backed up the Indian version based on sources on the ground) simply to prove that India’s armed forces (and by extension, PM Modi) were incompetent. It’s quite one thing to criticise your government, it’s another to end up echoing the official propaganda of your adversary, that too in a fiercely nationalist country, in wartime, on election eve. While this is impossible to gauge, this is where the BJP’s “idea of India” as “a civilisational culture” with a deep connection to itself and its past, as yet unexplained by European ideas of a nation state, held true. If you want proof of this concept, look how well the Congress did in Punjab where Captain Amarinder Singh refused to question the effectiveness of military action and publicly congratulated the government and forces. Nothing but anger against the Congress and its security PR strategy over Balakot strikes can explain the fact that the Congress has failed abysmally this election, gathering just  51 seats  or seven more seats than its 2014 tally, at the time of writing. There are two sides to this security coin. One is what has been discussed above, the fact that the Indian public is forgiving of security failures and does not like criticism at wartime (which it sees as borderline treason). But the other side of the coin (like in 1989) is anger against corruption in defence (which is equally seen as borderline treason). This is where Rahul Gandhi could have scored a victory over Modi with his “ Chowkidar chor hai ” campaign. However, yet again, Rahul Gandhi has made the cardinal mistake of hurling allegations, without anything remotely resembling proof, not even circumstantial. This was compounded by a Supreme Court verdict, seen as exonerating the government, and the final disgrace of Rahul Gandhi having to  apologise  to the Supreme Court for misquoting it (never matter that he didn’t actually withdraw his allegations). While none of the above narratives seeks to attribute mono-causality, we must understand every bit adds up and, in this case, this is how the national security card played out. With the benefit of hindsight, we can assume (and in India, these things are always assumptions) that national security played a big role in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The Congress’ corruption crusade never got off the ground and was seen as backfiring and alienating people. The party’s unintentional echoing of the Pakistani line on Balakot simply pushed that alienation past the point of no return. Ultimately Rahul needs to decide what he wants to run, a European-esque NGO with internationally fashionable positions, or a political party in a nationalistic country. Till then, it is safe to say national security will always favour the BJP, unless Rahul Gandhi replaces his national security advisers.

As the Supreme Court struck down Section 497 of the IPC, a sexist law on adultery, Thursday, Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra invoked an evocative analogy to emphasise the equality of women. “…The essentiality of the rights of women gets the real requisite space in the living room of individual dignity rather than… in an annexe to the main building,” he wrote, penning the judgment for himself and Justice A.M. Khanwilkar. A five-judge Constitution bench was unanimous in striking down the colonial-era law, which absolved men of guilt if they courted a married woman with her husband’s permission. Another controversial provision kept women out of the purview of punishment, with only men held accountable. In their judgments, the judges championed gender equality and lashed out at beliefs that held women as men’s property. Excerpts: CJI Dipak Misra (Writing for himself &amp; Justice A.M. Khanwilkar) Any system treating a woman with indignity, inequity and inequality or discrimination invites the wrath of the Constitution. Any provision that might have, few decades back, got the stamp of serene approval may have to meet its epitaph with the efflux of time and growing constitutional precepts and progressive perception. A woman cannot be asked to think as a man, or as how the society desires. Such a thought is abominable, for it slaughters her core identity. It is time to say that a husband is not the master. Equality is the governing parameter. All historical perceptions should evaporate and their obituaries be written. What might be acceptable at one point of time may melt into total insignificance at another point of time. However, it is worthy to note that the change perceived should not be in a sphere of fancy or individual fascination, but should be founded on the solid bedrock of change that the society has perceived, the spheres in which the legislature has responded, and the rights that have been accentuated by the constitutional courts.” At first blush, it may appear as if it (Section 497) is a beneficial legislation intended to serve the interests of women but, on closer examination, it would be found that the provision contained in the section is a kind of ‘romantic paternalism’ which stems from the assumption that women, like chattels, are the property of men. On a reading of the provision, it is demonstrable that women are treated as subordinate to men inasmuch as it lays down that when there is connivance or consent of the man, there is no offence. This treats the woman as chattel. It treats her as the property of man and totally subservient to the will of the master. …We are of the view that there cannot be a patriarchal monarchy over the daughter or, for that matter, husband’s monarchy over the wife. That apart, there cannot be a community exposition of masculine dominance. Treating adultery as an offence, we are disposed to think, would tantamount to the state entering into a real private realm. Adultery, in certain situations, may not be the cause of an unhappy marriage. It can be the result. Thinking of adultery from the point of view of criminality would be a retrograde step. This court has travelled on the path of transformative constitutionalism and, therefore, it is absolutely inappropriate to sit in a time machine to a different era where the machine moves on the path of regression. Justice Rohinton Nariman It will be noticed that the crime of adultery punishes only a third party male offender as against the crime of bigamy, which punishes the bigamist, be it a man or a woman. What is therefore punished as ‘adultery’ is not ‘adultery’ per se but the proprietary interest of a married man in his wife. What is clear, therefore, is that this archaic law has long outlived its purpose and does not square with today’s constitutional morality, in that the very object with which it was made has since become manifestly arbitrary, having lost its rationale long ago and having become in today’s day and age, utterly irrational. A statutory provision belonging to the hoary past which demeans or degrades the status of a woman obviously falls foul of modern constitutional doctrine and must be struck down on this ground also. Also, we are of the view that the statement in this judgment that stability of marriages is not an ideal to be scorned, can scarcely be applied to this provision, as we have seen that marital stability is not the object for which this provision was enacted. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud Over the years, legal reform has had a significant role in altering the position of women in societal orderings… However, in some cases, the law operates to perpetuate an unequal world for women. Thus, depending on the manner in which it is used, law can act as an agent of social change as well as social stagnation. The Constitution, both in text and interpretation, has played a significant role in the evolution of law from being an instrument of oppression to becoming one of liberation. A woman’s ‘purity’ and a man’s marital ‘entitlement’ to her exclusive sexual possession may be reflective of the antiquated social and sexual mores of the nineteenth century, but they cannot be recognised as being so today. It is not the “common morality” of the State at any time in history, but rather constitutional morality, which must guide the law. In enacting Section 497, the legislature made an ostensible effort to protect the institution of marriage. ‘Ostensible’ it is, because the provision postulates a notion of marriage which subverts the equality of spouses. Human sexuality is an essential aspect of identity. Choices in matters of sexuality are reflective of the human desire for expression. Sexuality cannot be construed purely as a physiological attribute. The sexual choices of an individual cannot obviously be imposed on others in society and are premised on a voluntary acceptance by consenting parties. Section 497 denudes the woman of the ability to make these fundamental choices, in postulating that it is only the man in a marital relationship who can consent to his spouse having sexual intercourse with another. Facially, the law may be construed to operate as an exemption from criminal sanctions. However, when viewed in the context of a social structure which considers the husband as the owner of the wife’s sexuality, the law perpetuates a deeply entrenched patriarchal order. Cultural stereotypes are more forgiving of a man engaging in sexual relations than a woman. Women then are expected to be chaste before and faithful during marriage. In restricting the sexual agency of women, Section 497 gives legal recognition to socially discriminatory and gender-based norms. Sexual relations for a woman were legally and socially permissible when it was within her marriage. Women who committed adultery or non-marital sex were labeled immoral, shameful, and were criminally condemned. Section 497 rests on and perpetuates stereotypes about women and sexual fidelity. In curtailing the sexual agency of women, it exacts sexual fidelity from women as the norm. The law on adultery is but a codified rule of patriarchy. Patriarchy has permeated the lives of women for centuries. Raising a woman to a pedestal is one part of the endeavour. The second part is all about confining her to a space. The boundaries of that space are defined by what a woman should or should not be. A society which perceives women as pure and an embodiment of virtue has no qualms subjecting them to virulent attack: to rape, honour killings, sex-determination and infanticide. Justice Indu Malhotra The element of public censure, visiting the delinquent with penal consequences, and overriding individual rights, would be justified only when the society is directly impacted by such conduct. In fact, a much stronger justification is required where an offence is punishable with imprisonment. The State must follow the minimalist approach in the criminalisation of offences, keeping in view the respect for the autonomy of the individual to make his/her personal choices. The right to live with dignity includes the right not to be subjected to public censure and punishment by the State except where absolutely necessary. Where a civil remedy for a wrongful act is sufficient, it may not warrant criminal sanction by the State.\n"]}],"source":["print(theprint_df['Link'][2462])\n","print(theprint_df['Article'][2462])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"vT1d3lYeHABA"},"outputs":[],"source":["articles_to_drop.append(2462)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ePPBxiTeHABA","outputId":"93bff13b-4a40-434b-a231-752eab209696"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Title</th>\n","      <th>Link</th>\n","      <th>Date</th>\n","      <th>Authors</th>\n","      <th>Topic</th>\n","      <th>Article</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2532</th>\n","      <td>Thank you, Supreme Court</td>\n","      <td>https://theprint.in/50-word-edit/thank-you-sup...</td>\n","      <td>6 September, 2018 1:14 pm</td>\n","      <td>ThePrint Team</td>\n","      <td>section 377</td>\n","      <td>The  50-word Edit  — ThePrint view on the most...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["                         Title  \\\n","2532  Thank you, Supreme Court   \n","\n","                                                   Link  \\\n","2532  https://theprint.in/50-word-edit/thank-you-sup...   \n","\n","                           Date        Authors        Topic  \\\n","2532  6 September, 2018 1:14 pm  ThePrint Team  section 377   \n","\n","                                                Article  \n","2532  The  50-word Edit  — ThePrint view on the most...
